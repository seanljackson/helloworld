/*******************************************************************************
    Hello World is the traditional first program written in a programming
    language.  It is a simple, introductory program that prints a line to the 
    terminal.  Here it is implemented in Java.  

    This header comment uses the block style which starts with a slash+asterick
    and is closed with an asterick+slash.  In the method main() there is an
    inline comment, which starts with a slash+slash.

    Java is an object-oriented language, and its objects are called classes.
    In this example, the class is HelloWorld.  If the class is to be executed
    there will need to be a method called main().

    compile:  javac HelloWorld.java
    execute:  java HelloWorld
    output:   $ Hello World!
*******************************************************************************/
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // prints Hello World! to the terminal
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
